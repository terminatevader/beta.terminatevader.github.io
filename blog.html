  <h1>4/5/2021</h1>
  <p>I woke up, got ready for school, and went to school. When I got home I thought I had homework, but I did it at school. I watched the Simpsons then I went to feed, water, and walk my aunt's dogs. Then I went back to watching the Simpsons, and I added a blog to my website. I ate dinner then went back to watching the Simpsons then I went to bed.</p>
